In some cases, your project may depend on R packages which are not available
from any external source, or that external source may not accessible from the
machine calling `renv::restore()`. To help accommodate these scenarios, `renv`
allows you to prepare a package "cellar", to be used as an ad-hoc repository of
packages during restore. This allows you to provide package tarballs that can be
used to restore packages which cannot be retrieved from any other source.

The environment variable `RENV_PATHS_CELLAR` can be used to customize the
package cellar location.  It should point to a directory containing package
binaries and sources, with a structure of the form:

- `${RENV_PATHS_CELLAR}/<package>_<version>.tar.gz`; or
- `${RENV_PATHS_CELLAR}/<package>/<package>_<version>.tar.gz`

Alternatively, you can also use a project-local cellar by placing your
packages within a folder located at `<project>/renv/cellar`. Note that this
folder does not exist by default; you must create it to opt-in.

- `<project>/renv/cellar/<package>_<version>.tar.gz`; or
- `<project>/renv/cellar/<package>/<package>_<version>.tar.gz`

As an example, if your project depended on a package `skeleton 1.0.0`, you could
place a tarball for this package in one of the following locations:

- `${RENV_PATHS_CELLAR}/skeleton_1.0.0.tar.gz`
- `${RENV_PATHS_CELLAR}/skeleton/skeleton_1.0.0.tar.gz`
- `<project>/renv/cellar/skeleton_1.0.0.tar.gz`; or
- `<project>/renv/cellar/skeleton/skeleton_1.0.0.tar.gz`

Once this is done, `renv` will consult these directories during future attempts
to restore your packages.

You can install a package from the cellar like any other package, i.e. `renv::install("skeleton")`.

During restore, if a compatible package is located within the cellar, that copy
of the package will be preferred even if that package might otherwise be
accessible from its associated remote source. For example, if `skeleton 1.0.0`
was also available on CRAN, `renv::restore()` would still use the tarball
available in the cellar rather than the version available from CRAN.

If you want to see what paths `renv` is using for the cellar, you can use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv:::renv_paths_cellar()
```

See `?paths` for more details.


## Explicit Sources

You can also provide explicit source paths in the lockfile if desired. This is
most useful if you are building an `renv` lockfile "by hand", or need to tweak
an existing lockfile to point at a separate package for installation. For
example, you could have a package record in `renv.lock` of the form:

```
{
  "Package": "skeleton",
  "Version": "1.0.1",
  "Source": "/mnt/r/pkg/skeleton_1.0.1.tar.gz"
}
```

Packages should have the following extensions, depending on whether the archive
contains a binary copy of the package or the package sources:

| **Platform** | **Binary** | **Sources** |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Windows      | `.zip`     | `.tar.gz`   |
| macOS        | `.tgz`     | `.tar.gz`   |
| Linux        | `.tar.gz`  | `.tar.gz`   |

Note that on Linux, both binaries and sources should have the `.tar.gz`
extension, but R and `renv` will handle this as appropriate during installation.
