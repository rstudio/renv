The `renv` package is a new effort to bring project-local R dependency
management to your projects. The goal is for `renv` to be a robust, stable
replacement for the [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package, with
fewer surprises and better default behaviors.

Underlying the philosophy of `renv` is that any of your existing workflows
should just work as they did before -- `renv` helps manage library paths (and
other project-specific state) to help isolate your project's R dependencies,
and the existing tools you've used for managing R packages (e.g.
`install.packages()`, `remove.packages()`) should work as before.


## Workflow

The general workflow when working with `renv` is:

1. Call `renv::init()` to initialize a new project-local environment with a
   private R library,

2. Work in the project as normal, installing and removing new R packages as
   they are needed in the project,

3. Call `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of the project library to the
   lockfile (called `renv.lock`),

4. Continue working on your project, installing and updating R packages as
   needed.

5. Call `renv::snapshot()` again to save the state of your project library if
   your attempts to update R packages were successful, or call `renv::restore()`
   to revert to the previous state as encoded in the lockfile if your attempts
   to update packages introduced some new problems.

The `renv::init()` function attempts to ensure the newly-created project
library includes all R packages currently used by the project. It does this
by crawling any R files within the project for dependencies with the
`renv::dependencies()` function. The discovered packages are then installed
into the project library with the `renv::hydrate()` function, which will also
attempt to save time by copying packages from your user library (rather than
re-installing from CRAN) as appropriate.

Calling `renv::init()` will also write out the infrastructure necessary to
automatically load and use the private library for new R sessions launched
from the project root directory. This is accomplished by creating (or amending)
a project-local `.Rprofile` with the necessary code to load the project when
the R session is started.

If you'd like to initialize a project without attempting dependency discovery
and installation -- that is, you'd prefer to manually install the packages
your project requires on your own -- you can use `renv::init(bare = TRUE)`
to initialize a project with an empty project library.


## Reproducibility

With Packrat, one can save and restore the state of the private library with
`packrat::snapshot()` and `packrat::restore()`. The same model is used here:

- Call `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of your project to a lockfile; and
  
- Call `renv::restore()` to restore the state of your project from a lockfile.

Be aware that `renv::restore()` may fail if a package was originally installed
through a CRAN-available binary, but that binary is no longer available. `renv`
will attempt to install the package from sources in this situation, but attempts
to install from source can (and often do) fail due to missing system
prerequisites for compilation of a package. On Windows, the `renv::equip()`
function may be useful -- it will download external software commonly used when
compiling R packages from sources, and instruct R to use that software during
compilation.

By default, `renv` will maintain and use a global cache of packages during
`renv::restore()`, so (at least on the same machine) if that cache is maintained
old projects will be restored by copying or linking from an installation
discovered in the cache.


## Infrastructure

The following files are written to and used by projects using `renv`:

| **File**          | **Usage**                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.Rprofile`       | Used to activate `renv` for new R sessions launched in the project.                 |
| `renv.lock`       | The lockfile, describing the state of your project's library at some point in time. |
| `renv/activate.R` | The activation script run by the project `.Rprofile`.                               |
| `renv/library`    | The private project library.                                                        |

In particular, `renv/activate.R` ensures that the project library is made
active for newly launched R sessions. This effectively ensures that any
new R processes launched within the project directory are isolated.
 
For development and collaboration, the `.Rprofile`, `renv.lock` and
`renv/activate.R` files should be committed to your version control system; the
`renv/library` directory should normally be ignored. Note that `renv::init()`
will attempt to write the requisite ignore statements to the project
`.gitignore`.


## Upgrading renv

After initializing a project with `renv`, that project will then be 'bound'
to the particular version of `renv` that was used to initialize the project.
If you need to upgrade (or otherwise change) the version of `renv` associated
with a project, you can use `renv::upgrade()`. Currently, this will (by default)
install the latest version of `renv` available from GitHub; once CRAN releases
of `renv` are available, we will likely prefer installation of the latest CRAN
release.

With each commit of `renv`, we bump the package version and also tag the
commit with the associated package version. This implies that you can call
(for example) `renv::upgrade(version = "0.3.0-17")` to request the installation
of that particular version of `renv` if so required.


## Cache

One of `renv`'s primary features is the use of a global package cache, which
is shared across all projects using `renv`. The cache works as follows:

1. During `renv::init()`, package dependencies in the project are discovered.
2. These dependencies are then installed into the `renv` cache.
3. These packages are then linked into the project library.

This allows a single package installation to be shared across multiple projects,
while allowing these projects to still remain isolated from one another. Because
each project uses its own project library, packages can be upgraded as needed
without risk of affecting any other projects still using the previous version
of the package.

By default, `renv` generates its cache in the following folders:

| **Platform** | **Location**                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Linux        | `~/.local/share/renv`                |
| macOS        | `~/Library/Application Support/renv` |
| Windows      | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/renv`                |

If you'd like to share the package cache across multiple users, you can do so by
setting the `RENV_PATHS_CACHE` environment variable as required. This variable
can be set in an R startup file to make it apply to all R sessions. For example,
it could be set within:

- A project-local `.Renviron`;
- The user-level `.Renviron`;
- A file at `$(R RHOME)/etc/Renviron.site`.

While we recommend enabling the cache by default, if you're having trouble with
`renv` when the cache is enabled, it can be disabled by setting the project
setting `renv::settings$use.cache(FALSE)`. Doing this will ensure that packages
are then installed into your project library directly, without attempting to
link and use packages from the `renv` cache.

If you find a problematic package has entered the cache (for example, an
installed package has become corrupted), that package can be removed with the
`renv::purge()` function.


## Installation from Source

In the end, `renv` still needs to install R packages -- either from binaries
available from CRAN, or from sources when binaries are not available.
Installation from source can be challenging for a few reasons:

1. Your system will need to have a compatible compiler toolchain available.
   In some cases, R packages may depend on C / C++ features that aren't
   available in an older system toolchain, especially in some older Linux
   enterprise environments.

2. Your system will need requisite system libraries, as many R packages contain
   compiled C / C++ code that depend on and link to these packages.

## Downloads

By default, `renv` uses [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) for file downloads
when available. This allows `renv` to support a number of download features
across multiple versions of R, including:

- Custom headers (used especially for authentication),
- Connection timeouts,
- Download retries on transient errors.

If `curl` is not available on your machine, it is highly recommended that you
install it. Newer versions of Windows 10 come with a bundled version of
`curl.exe`; other users on Windows can use `renv::equip()` to download and
install a recent copy of `curl`. Newer versions of macOS come with a bundled
version of `curl` that is adequate for usage with `renv`, and most Linux package
managers have a modern version of `curl` available in their repositories.

`curl` downloads can be configured through `renv`'s configuration settings --
see `?renv::config` for more details.

### Proxies

If your downloads need to go through a proxy server, then there are a variety of
approaches you can take to make this work:

1. Set the `http_proxy` and / or `https_proxy` environment variables. These
   environment variables can contain the full URL to your proxy server,
   including a username + password if necessary.

2. You can use a `.curlrc` (`_curlrc` on Windows) to provide information about
   the proxy server to be used. This file should be placed in your home folder
   (see `Sys.getenv("HOME")`, or `Sys.getenv("R_USER")` on Windows);
   alternatively, you can set the `CURL_HOME` environment variable to point
   to a custom 'home' folder to be used by `curl` when resolving the runtime
   configuration file. On Windows, you can also place your `_curlrc` in the
   same directory where the `curl.exe` binary is located.

See the curl documentation on [proxies](https://ec.haxx.se/usingcurl-proxies.html)
and [config files](https://ec.haxx.se/cmdline-configfile.html) for more details.

As an [example](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/146), the following
`_curlrc` works when using authentication with NTLM and SSPI on Windows:

```
--proxy "your.proxy.dns:port"
--proxy-ntlm
--proxy-user ":"
--insecure
```

The [curl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl) R package also has a helper:

```
curl::ie_get_proxy_for_url()
```

which may be useful when attempting to discover this proxy address.


## Authentication

Your project may make use of packages which are available from remote sources
requiring some form of authentication to access -- for example, a GitHub
enterprise server. Usually, either a personal access token (PAT) or username
+ password combination is required for authentication. `renv` is able to
authenticate when downloading from such sources, using the same system as the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package.
In particular, environment variables are used to record and transfer the
required authentication information.

| **Remote Source** | **Authentication**                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| GitHub            | `GITHUB_PAT`                            |
| GitLab            | `GITLAB_PAT`                            |
| Bitbucket         | `BITBUCKET_USER` + `BITBUCKET_PASSWORD` |
| Git Remotes       | `GIT_PAT` / `GIT_USER` + `GIT_PASSWORD` |

These credentials can be stored in e.g. `.Renviron`, or can be set in your R
session through other means as appropriate.

If you require custom authentication for different packages (for example, your
project makes use of packages available on different GitHub enterprise servers),
you can use the `renv.auth` R option to provide package-specific authentication
settings. `renv.auth` can either be a a named list associating package names
with environment variables, or a function accepting a package name + record, and
returning a list of environment variables. For example:

```r
# define a function providing authentication
options(renv.auth = function(package, record) {
  if (package == "MyPackage")
    return(list(GITHUB_PAT = "<pat>"))
})

# use a named list directly
options(renv.auth = list(
  MyPackage = list(GITHUB_PAT = "<pat>")
))

# alternatively, set package-specific option
options(renv.auth.MyPackage = list(GITHUB_PAT = "<pat>"))
```

For packages installed from Git remotes, `renv` will attempt to use `git` from
the command line to download and restore the associated package. Hence, it is
recommended that authentication is done through SSH keys when possible.


## Shims

To help you take advantage of the package cache, `renv` places a couple of
shims on the search path:

| **Function**         | **Shim**          |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| `install.packages()` | `renv::install()` |
| `remove.packages()`  | `renv::remove()`  |
| `update.packages()`  | `renv::update()`  |

This can be useful when installing packages which have already been cached.
For example, if you use `renv::install("dplyr")`, and `renv` detects that
the latest version on CRAN has already been cached, then `renv` will just
install using the copy available in the cache -- thereby skipping some of
the installation overhead.

If you'd prefer not to use the `renv` shims, they can be disabled by setting
the option `options(renv.config.shims.enabled = FALSE)`. See `?config`
for more details.


## History

If you're using a version control system with your project, then as you call
`renv::snapshot()` and later commit new lockfiles to your repository, you may
find it necessary later to recover older versions of your lockfiles. `renv`
provides the functions `renv::history()` to list previous revisions of your
lockfile, and `renv::revert()` to recover these older lockfiles.

Currently, only Git repositories are supported by `renv::history()` and
`renv::revert()`.


## Comparison with Packrat

`renv` differs from Packrat in the following ways:

1. The `renv` lockfile `renv.lock` is formatted as [JSON](https://www.json.org/).
   This should make the lockfile easier to use and consume with other tools.

2. `renv` no longer attempts to explicitly download and track R package source
   tarballs within your project. This was a frustrating default that operated
   under the assumption that you might later want to be able to restore a
   project's private library without access to a CRAN repository; in practice,
   this is almost never the case, and the time spent downloading + storing the
   package sources seemed to outweigh the potential reproducibility benefits.

3. Packrat tried to maintain the distinction between so-called 'stale' packages;
   that is, R packages which were installed by Packrat but were not recorded
   in the lockfile for some reason. This distinction was (1) overall not useful,
   and (2) confusing. `renv` no longer makes this distinction:
   `snapshot()` saves the state of your project library to `renv.lock`,
   `restore()` loads the state of your project library from `renv.lock`, and
   that's all.

4. In `renv`, the global package cache is enabled by default. This should
   reduce overall disk-space usage as packages can effectively be shared
   across each project using `renv`.

5. `renv`'s dependency discovery machinery is more configurable. The function
   `renv::dependencies()` is exported, and users can create `.renvignore` files
   to instruct `renv` to ignore specific files and folders in their projects.
   (See `?renv::dependencies` for more information.)


## Migrating from Packrat

The `renv::migrate()` function makes it possible to migrate projects from
Packrat to `renv`. See the `?migrate` documentation for more details. In
essence, calling `renv::migrate("<project path>")` will be enough to
migrate the Packrat library and lockfile such that they can then be
used by `renv`.


## Future Work

`renv`, like Packrat, is designed to work standalone without the need to
depend on any non-base R packages. However, the following (future) integrations
are planned:

- Use [pak](https://github.com/r-lib/pak) for parallel package installation,

- Use [sysreqsdb](https://github.com/r-hub/sysreqsdb) to validate and install
  system dependencies as required before attempting to install the associated
  packages.

These integrations will be optional (so that `renv` can always work standalone)
but we hope that they will further improve the speed and reliability of `renv`.
