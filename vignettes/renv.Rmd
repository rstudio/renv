The `renv` package is a new effort to bring project-local R dependency
management to your projects. The goal is for `renv` to be a robust, stable
replacement for the [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package, with
fewer surprises and better default behaviors.

Underlying the philosophy of `renv` is that any of your existing workflows
should just work as they did before -- `renv` helps manage library paths (and
other project-specific state) to help isolate your project's R dependencies,
and the existing tools you've used for managing R packages (e.g.
`install.packages()`, `remove.packages()`) should work as they did before.


## Workflow

The general workflow when working with `renv` is:

1. Call `renv::init()` to initialize a new project-local environment with a
   private R library,

2. Work in the project as normal, installing and removing new R packages as
   they are needed in the project,

3. Call `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of the project library to the
   lockfile (called `renv.lock`),

4. Continue working on your project, installing and updating R packages as
   needed.

5. Call `renv::snapshot()` again to save the state of your project library if
   your attempts to update R packages were successful, or call `renv::restore()`
   to revert to the previous state as encoded in the lockfile if your attempts
   to update packages introduced some new problems.

The `renv::init()` function attempts to ensure the newly-created project
library includes all R packages currently used by the project. It does this
by crawling R files within the project for dependencies with the
`renv::dependencies()` function. The discovered packages are then installed
into the project library with the `renv::hydrate()` function, which will also
attempt to save time by copying packages from your user library (rather than
reinstalling from CRAN) as appropriate.

Calling `renv::init()` will also write out the infrastructure necessary to
automatically load and use the private library for new R sessions launched
from the project root directory. This is accomplished by creating (or amending)
a project-local `.Rprofile` with the necessary code to load the project when
the R session is started.

If you'd like to initialize a project without attempting dependency discovery
and installation -- that is, you'd prefer to manually install the packages
your project requires on your own -- you can use `renv::init(bare = TRUE)`
to initialize a project with an empty project library.

### Installation

Once in a renv project, you can use `renv::install()`, `renv::update()`, and `renv::remove()` to add news packages, update existing packages, and remove no longer needed packages. 

For convenience (and muscle memory) you can continue to use `install.packages()`, `update.packages()`, and `remove.packages()`, because renv automatically replaces these with shims that call the underlying renv functions. 

Learn more about package installation in `vignette("package-install")`.

## Reproducibility

Using `renv`, it's possible to "save" and "load" the state of your project
library. More specifically, you can use:

- `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of your project to `renv.lock`; and
  
- `renv::restore()` to restore the state of your project from `renv.lock`.

For each package used in your project, `renv` will record the package version,
and (if known) the external source from which that package can be retrieved.
`renv::restore()` uses that information to retrieve and reinstall those
packages in your project.

### Anatomy of a lockfile

`renv` uses a **lockfile** to capture the state of your \R library at some point
in time. It is stored as a collection of *records*, with different records
defining:

- The version of `renv` used when generating the lockfile;
- The version of `R` used in that project;
- The R repositories that were active when the lockfile was created;
- *Package records* defining each R package, their version, and their
  installation source.

Here is an example lockfile, including the packages `markdown` and `mime`:

```
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "`r getRversion()`",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cloud.r-project.org"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
    "markdown": {
      "Package": "markdown",
      "Version": "1.0",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "4584a57f565dd7987d59dda3a02cfb41"
    },
    "mime": {
      "Package": "mime",
      "Version": "0.7",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "908d95ccbfd1dd274073ef07a7c93934"
    }
  }
}
```

The function `renv::snapshot()` is used to create this lockfile, and by default
writes these records to the file `renv.lock`. Later, if you need to reinstall
the specific package versions as recorded in `renv.lock`, you can use
`renv::restore()`.

### Package Records

Package records are created using the currently-installed copies of packages as
a "source of truth". The fields written into each package record are derived
from the installed package's `DESCRIPTION` file.

Note that the package records created from packages installed using
`pak::pkg_install()` may have a format different from a package installed with
`utils::install.packages()`. This is because `pak` writes out a variety of
other metadata into the package `DESCRIPTION` file after installation, including
a number of `Remote` fields that further describe where the package was
retrieved from, and the type of package that was installed.

### Caveats

It is important to emphasize that **renv is not a panacea for reproducibility**.
Rather, it is a tool that can help make projects reproducible by solving one
small part of the problem: it records the version of R + R packages being used
in a project, and provides tools for reinstalling the declared versions of
those packages in a project. Ultimately, making a project reproducible requires
some thoughtfulness from the user: what does it mean for a particular project to
be reproducible, and how can `renv` (and other tools) be used to accomplish
that particular goal of reproducibility?

There are a still a number of factors that can affect whether this project
could truly be reproducible in the future -- for example,

1. The results produced by a particular project might depend on other 
   components of the system it's being run on -- for example, the operating
   system itself, the versions of system libraries in use, the compiler(s)
   used to compile R and the R packages used, and so on. Keeping a 'stable'
   machine image is a separate challenge, but [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
   is one popular solution. See also `vignette("docker", package = "renv")` for
   recommendations on how Docker can be used together with `renv`.

2. The R packages that the project depends on may no longer be available.
   If your project depends on R packages available on CRAN, it's possible those
   packages may be removed in the future -- either by request of the package
   maintainer, or by the maintainers of CRAN itself. This is quite rare, but
   needs consideration if reproducibility of a project is paramount.

In addition, be aware that package installation may fail if a package was
originally installed through a CRAN-available binary, but that binary is no
longer available. `renv` will attempt to install the package from sources in
this situation, but attempts to install from source can (and often do) fail due
to missing system prerequisites for compilation of a package. The
`renv::equip()` function may be useful in these scenarios, especially on Windows:
it will download external software commonly used when compiling R packages from
sources, and instruct R to use that software during compilation.

A salient example of this is the `rmarkdown` package, as it relies heavily on
the [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/) command line utility. However, because
pandoc is not bundled with the `rmarkdown` package (it is normally provided by
RStudio, or installed separately by the user), simply restoring an `renv`
project using `rmarkdown` may not be sufficient -- one also needs to ensure the
project is run in a environment with the correct version of `pandoc` available.

## Infrastructure

The following files are written to and used by projects using `renv`:

| **File**            | **Usage**                                                                           |
| -----------------   | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.Rprofile`         | Used to activate `renv` for new R sessions launched in the project.                 |
| `renv.lock`         | The lockfile, describing the state of your project's library at some point in time. |
| `renv/activate.R`   | The activation script run by the project `.Rprofile`.                               |
| `renv/library`      | The private project library.                                                        |
| `renv/settings.json` | Project settings -- see `?settings` for more details.                              |

In particular, `renv/activate.R` ensures that the project library is made active
for newly launched R sessions. It is automatically sourced via a call to
`source("renv/activate.R")`, which is inserted into the project `.Rprofile` when
`renv::init()` or `renv::activate()` is called. This ensures that any new R
processes launched within the project directory will use the project library,
and hence are isolated from the regular user library.
 
For development and collaboration, the `.Rprofile`, `renv.lock` and
`renv/activate.R` files should be committed to your version control system; the
`renv/library` directory should normally be ignored. Note that `renv::init()`
will attempt to write the requisite ignore statements to the project
`.gitignore`.


## Dependency Discovery

By default, `renv::snapshot()` will examine your project's R files to determine
which packages are used in your project, and will include only those packages
(alongside their recursive dependencies) in the lockfile. This is done via
a call to the `renv::dependencies()` function. We call this an "implicit"
snapshot, since the packages your project depends on are implicit based on how
packages appear to be used in your project. `renv` uses static analysis to
determine which packages appear to be used; e.g. by scanning your code for calls
to `library()` or `require()`.

While useful, this approach is not 100% reliable in detecting the packages
required by your project. If you find that `renv`'s dependency discovery is
failing to discover one or more packages used in your project, one escape hatch
is to include a file called `_dependencies.R` with code of the form:

```
library(<pkg>)
```


### Ignore Files

By default, `renv` reads the `.gitignore` files in your project (if any)
to infer which files should be ignored when scanning for dependencies.
If you find that `renv`'s dependency discovery is scanning files you don't
want to be scanned, you can use an `.renvignore` file to instruct `renv`
to ignore certain patterns of files in the project. For example, you might
use:

```
/data
```

to tell `renv` not to scan files within the `data` folder.

If you'd prefer that `renv` ignored all folders by default, except for some
subset of folders where you place your code files, you could use something
like:

```
*
!/code
```

In this case, `renv` will only scan your `code` folder at the root of the
project directory for dependencies.


### Explicit Snapshots

If you'd instead prefer to explicitly declare which packages are used in your
project, you can do so by creating a `DESCRIPTION` file at your project root.
These `DESCRIPTION` files should be formatted similarly to those used by
default in R package development -- see [the R-pkgs book][r-pkgs:description]
for more details.

In this case, your `DESCRIPTION` file might look like:

```
Type: project
Description: My project.
Depends:
    tidyverse,
    devtools,
    shiny,
    data.table
```

The packages used in your project can be part of either the `Depends` or
`Imports` fields.

## Collaborating

When sharing a project with other collaborators, you may want to ensure everyone
is working with the same environment -- otherwise, code in the project may
unexpectedly fail to run because of changes in behavior between different
versions of the packages in use. `renv` can help to make such collaboration
easier -- see `vignette("collaborating", package = "renv")` for more details.

## Package sources

`renv` is able to install and restore packages from a variety of sources,
including:

- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/),
- [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/),
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

You can learn more about what souces renv supports in `vignette("package-sources")`.

## Upgrading renv

After initializing a project with `renv`, that project will then be 'bound'
to the particular version of `renv` that was used to initialize the project.
If you need to upgrade (or otherwise change) the version of `renv` associated
with a project, you can use `renv::upgrade()`. This will install the
latest-available version of `renv` from your declared package repositories.
Alternatively, if you're currently using a development version of `renv` as
installed from GitHub in your project, then `renv` will install the
latest-available version of `renv` from GitHub.

With each commit of `renv`, we bump the package version and also tag the
commit with the associated package version. This implies that you can call,
for example:

```
renv::upgrade(version = "`r renv:::renv_package_version("renv")`")
```

to request the installation of that particular version of `renv` if so required.


## History

If you're using a version control system with your project, then as you call
`renv::snapshot()` and later commit new lockfiles to your repository, you may
find it necessary later to recover older versions of your lockfiles. `renv`
provides the functions `renv::history()` to list previous revisions of your
lockfile, and `renv::revert()` to recover these older lockfiles.

Currently, only Git repositories are supported by `renv::history()` and
`renv::revert()`.


## Comparison with Packrat

`renv` differs from Packrat in the following ways:

1. The `renv` lockfile `renv.lock` is formatted as [JSON](https://www.json.org/).
   This should make the lockfile easier to use and consume with other tools.

2. `renv` no longer attempts to explicitly download and track R package source
   tarballs within your project. This was a frustrating default that operated
   under the assumption that you might later want to be able to restore a
   project's private library without access to a CRAN repository. In practice,
   this is almost never the case, and the time spent downloading + storing the
   package sources seemed to outweigh the potential reproducibility benefits.

3. Packrat tried to maintain the distinction between so-called 'stale' packages;
   that is, R packages which were installed by Packrat but were not recorded
   in the lockfile for some reason. This distinction was (1) overall not useful,
   and (2) confusing. `renv` no longer makes this distinction:
   `snapshot()` saves the state of your project library to `renv.lock`,
   `restore()` loads the state of your project library from `renv.lock`, and
   that's all.

4. In `renv`, the global package cache is enabled by default. This should
   reduce overall disk-space usage as packages can effectively be shared
   across each project using `renv`.

5. `renv`'s dependency discovery machinery is more configurable. The function
   `renv::dependencies()` is exported, and users can create `.renvignore` files
   to instruct `renv` to ignore specific files and folders in their projects.
   (See `?renv::dependencies` for more information.)


## Migrating from Packrat

The `renv::migrate()` function makes it possible to migrate projects from
Packrat to `renv`. See the `?migrate` documentation for more details. In
essence, calling `renv::migrate("<project path>")` will be enough to
migrate the Packrat library and lockfile such that they can then be
used by `renv`.


## Uninstalling renv

If you find `renv` isn't the right fit for your project, deactivating and
uninstalling it is easy.

- To deactivate `renv` in a project, use `renv::deactivate()`. This removes
  the `renv` auto-loader from the project `.Rprofile`, but doesn't touch any
  other `renv` files used in the project. If you'd like to later re-activate
  `renv`, you can do so with `renv::activate()`.
  
- To remove `renv` from a project, use `renv::deactivate()` to first remove
  the `renv` auto-loader from the project `.Rprofile`, then delete the project's
  `renv` folder and `renv.lock` lockfile as desired.

If you want to completely remove any installed `renv` infrastructure components
from your entire system, you can do so with the following R code:

```
root <- renv::paths$root()
unlink(root, recursive = TRUE)
```

The `renv` package can then also be uninstalled via:

```
utils::remove.packages("renv")
```

Note that if you've customized any of `renv`'s infrastructure paths as described
in `?renv::paths`, then you'll need to find and remove those customized folders
as well.


## Future Work

`renv`, like Packrat, is designed to work standalone without the need to
depend on any non-base R packages. However, the following (future) integrations
are planned:

- Use [pak](https://github.com/r-lib/pak) for parallel package installation,

- Use [sysreqsdb](https://github.com/r-hub/sysreqsdb) to validate and install
  system dependencies as required before attempting to install the associated
  packages.

These integrations will be optional (so that `renv` can always work standalone)
but we hope that they will further improve the speed and reliability of `renv`.
