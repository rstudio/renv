When building, deploying, or testing with continuous integration (CI) systems
(e.g. [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.org), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com),
and others), one often needs to download and install a set of R packages
before the service can be run. Normally, one will have to download and
re-install these packages on each build, which can often be slow -- especially
in environments where binary packages are not available from your R
package repositories.

`renv` can often be helpful in these situations. The general idea is:

1. Call `renv::snapshot()` on your local machine, to generate `renv.lock`;

2. Call `renv::restore()` on your CI service, to restore the project library
   from `renv.lock`;
   
3. Ensure that the project library, as well as the global `renv` cache, are
   cached by the CI service.

Normally, `renv` will use the R package repositories as encoded in `renv.lock`
during restore, and this will override any repositories set in other locations
(e.g. in `.Rprofile` or `.Rprofile.site`). We'll discuss some strategies for
providing an alternate R package repository to use during restore below.

## Travis CI

On Travis CI, one can add the following entries to `.travis.yml` to accomplish
the above:

```
cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.local/share/renv
  - $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/renv/library

install:
  - Rscript -e "renv::restore()"
  
script:
  - Rscript -e '<your-build-action>'
```

Note that we provide both `install` and `script` steps, as we want to
override the default behaviors provided by Travis for R (which might
attempt to install different version of R packages than what is currently
encoded in `renv.lock`). See
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/#customizing-the-travis-build-steps
for more details.

It's also possible to override the package repository used during restore by
setting the `RENV_CONFIG_REPOS_OVERRIDE` environment variable. For example:

```
env:
  global:
    - RENV_CONFIG_REPOS_OVERRIDE=<cran>
```

replacing `<cran>` with your desired R package repository. This can also be
accomplished in a similar way by setting:

```
options(renv.config.repos.override = <...>)
```

but it is generally more ergonomic to set the associated environment variable.
(See `?config` for more details.) This can be useful if you'd like to, for
example, enforce the usage of a [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com) checkpoint
during restore, or another similarly-equipped repository.

See <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching> for more details on how Travis
manages caching.
