\usage{
checkout(
  repos = NULL,
  ...,
  packages = NULL,
  date = NULL,
  clean = FALSE,
  project = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{repos}{The \R package repositories to use.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, reserved for future expansion. If any arguments
are matched to \code{...}, renv will signal an error.}

\item{packages}{The packages to be installed. When \code{NULL} (the default),
all packages currently used in the project will be installed, as
determined by \code{\link[=dependencies]{dependencies()}}. The recursive dependencies of these
packages will be included as well.}

\item{date}{The snapshot date to use. When set, the associated snapshot as
available from the Posit's public
\href{https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/}{Package Manager} instance will be
used. Ignored if \code{repos} is non-\code{NULL}.}

\item{clean}{Boolean; remove packages not recorded in the lockfile from
the target library? Use \code{clean = TRUE} if you'd like the library state
to exactly reflect the lockfile contents after \code{restore()}.}

\item{project}{The project directory. If \code{NULL}, then the active project will
be used. If no project is currently active, then the current working
directory is used instead.}

\description{
\code{renv::checkout()} can be used to install the latest packages available from
a (set of) package repositories.
}
\details{
\code{renv::checkout()} is most useful with services like the Posit's
\href{https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/}{Package Manager}, as it
can be used to switch between different repository snapshots within an
renv project. In this way, you can upgrade (or downgrade) all of the
packages used in a particular renv project to the package versions
provided by a particular snapshot.

If your library contains packages installed from other remote sources (e.g.
GitHub), but a version of a package of the same name is provided by the
repositories being checked out, then please be aware that the package will be
replaced with the version provided by the requested repositories. This could
be a concern if your project uses \R packages from GitHub whose name matches
that of an existing CRAN package, but is otherwise unrelated to the package
on CRAN.

Note that \code{renv::checkout()} does not update the project lockfile; it only
installs the packages from the provided repository. You should call
\code{\link[=snapshot]{snapshot()}} after you've confirmed that the installed packages function as
expected in your project.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# check out packages from PPM using the date '2023-01-02'
renv::checkout(date = "2023-01-02")

# alternatively, supply the full repository path
renv::checkout(repos = "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/cran/2023-01-02")

# only check out some subset of packages (and their recursive dependencies)
renv::checkout(packages = "dplyr", date = "2023-01-02")

}
