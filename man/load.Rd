\title{Load a Project}
\usage{
load(project = NULL, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{The project directory. If \code{NULL}, then the active project will
be used. If no project is currently active, then the current working
directory is used instead.}

\item{quiet}{Boolean; be quiet during load?}
}
\value{
The project directory, invisibly. Note that this function is normally
called for its side effects.
}
\description{
\code{renv::load()} sets the library paths to use a project-local library,
sets up the system library \link{sandbox}, if needed, and creates shims
for \code{install.packages()}, \code{update.packages()}, and \code{remove.packages()}.

You should not generally need to call \code{renv::load()} yourself, as it's
called automatically by the project auto-loader created by \code{\link[=init]{init()}}/
\code{\link[=activate]{activate()}}. However, if needed, you can use \code{renv::load("<project>")}
to explicitly load an \code{renv} project located at a particular path.
}
\section{Shims}{
To help you take advantage of the package cache, \code{renv} places a couple of
shims on the search path:
\itemize{
\item \code{install.packages()} instead calls \code{renv::install()}.
\item \code{remove.packages()} instead calls \code{renv::remove()}.
\item \code{update.packages()} instead calls \code{renv::update()}.
}

This allows you to keep using your existing muscle memory for installing,
updating, and remove packages, while taking advantage of \code{renv} features
like the package cache.

If you'd like to bypass these shims within an \R session, you can explicitly
call the version of these functions from the \code{utils} package, e.g. with
\verb{utils::install.packages(<...>)}.

If you'd prefer not to use the \code{renv} shims at all, they can be disabled by
setting the R option \code{options(renv.config.shims.enabled = FALSE)} or by
setting the environment variable \code{RENV_CONFIG_SHIMS_ENABLED = FALSE}. See
\code{?config} for more details.
