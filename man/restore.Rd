\usage{
restore(
  project = NULL,
  ...,
  library = NULL,
  lockfile = NULL,
  packages = NULL,
  exclude = NULL,
  rebuild = FALSE,
  repos = NULL,
  clean = FALSE,
  prompt = interactive()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{The project directory. If \code{NULL}, then the active project will
be used. If no project is currently active, then the current working
directory is used instead.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, reserved for future expansion. If any arguments
are matched to \code{...}, \code{renv} will signal an error.}

\item{library}{The library paths to be used during restore. See \strong{Library}
for details.}

\item{lockfile}{The lockfile to be used for restoration of the associated
project. When \code{NULL}, the most recently generated lockfile for this project
is used.}

\item{packages}{A subset of packages recorded in the lockfile to restore.
When \code{NULL} (the default), all packages available in the lockfile will be
restored. Any required recursive dependencies of the requested packages
will be restored as well.}

\item{exclude}{A subset of packages to be excluded during restore. This can
be useful for when you'd like to restore all but a subset of packages from
a lockfile. Note that if you attempt to exclude a package which is required
as the recursive dependency of another package, your request will be
ignored.}

\item{rebuild}{Force packages to be rebuilt, thereby bypassing any installed
versions of the package available in the cache? This can either be a
boolean (indicating that all installed packages should be rebuilt), or a
vector of package names indicating which packages should be rebuilt.}

\item{repos}{The repositories to use during restore, for packages installed
from CRAN or another similar R package repository. When set, this will
override any repositories declared in the lockfile. See also the
\code{repos.override} option in \link{config} for an alternate way to provide a
repository override.}

\item{clean}{Boolean; remove packages not recorded in the lockfile from
the target library? Use \code{clean = TRUE} if you'd like the library state
to exactly reflect the lockfile contents after \code{restore()}.}

\item{prompt}{Boolean; prompt the user before taking any action? For backwards
compatibility, \code{confirm} is accepted as an alias for \code{prompt}.}
}
\value{
A named list of package records which were installed by \code{renv}.
}
\description{
Restore a project's dependencies from a lockfile, as previously generated by
\code{\link[=snapshot]{snapshot()}}.
}
\section{Package Repositories}{


By default, the package repositories encoded in the lockfile will be used
during restore, as opposed to the repositories that might already
be set in the current session (through \code{getOption("repos")}). If you'd like
to override the repositories used by \code{renv} during restore, you can use,
for example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{renv::restore(repos = c(CRAN = <...>))
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

See also the \code{repos.override} option in \link{config} for an alternate way to
provide a repository override.
}

\section{Library}{


When \code{renv::restore()} is called, packages from the lockfile are compared
against packages currently installed in the library paths specified by
\code{library}. Any packages which have changed will then be installed into the
default library. If \code{clean = TRUE}, then packages that exist within the
default library, but aren't recorded in the lockfile, will be removed as
well.

# disable automatic snapshots
auto.snapshot <- getOption("renv.config.auto.snapshot")

# initialize a new project (with an empty R library)
renv::init(bare = TRUE)

# install digest 0.6.19
renv::install("digest@0.6.19")

# save library state to lockfile
renv::snapshot()

# remove digest from library
renv::remove("digest")

# check library status
renv::status()

# restore lockfile, thereby reinstalling digest 0.6.19
renv::restore()

# restore automatic snapshots
options(renv.config.auto.snapshot = auto.snapshot)
