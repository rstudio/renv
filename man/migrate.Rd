\section{Migration}{


When migrating Packrat projects to renv, the set of components migrated
can be customized using the \code{packrat} argument. The set of components that
can be migrated are as follows:

\tabular{ll}{

\strong{Name} \tab \strong{Description} \cr

\code{lockfile} \tab
Migrate the Packrat lockfile (\code{packrat/packrat.lock}) to the renv lockfile
(\code{renv.lock}). \cr

\code{sources} \tab
Migrate package sources from the \code{packrat/src} folder to the renv
sources folder. Currently, only CRAN packages are migrated to renv --
packages retrieved from other sources (e.g. GitHub) are ignored.
\cr

\code{library} \tab
Migrate installed packages from the Packrat library to the renv project
library.
\cr

\code{options} \tab
Migrate compatible Packrat options to the renv project.
\cr

\code{cache} \tab
Migrate packages from the Packrat cache to the renv cache.
\cr

}
}

\dontrun{

# migrate Packrat project infrastructure to renv
renv::migrate()

}
