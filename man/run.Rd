}
\arguments{
\item{script}{The path to an \R script.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, reserved for future expansion. If any arguments
are matched to \code{...}, renv will signal an error.}

\item{job}{Run the requested script as an RStudio job? Requires a recent
version of both RStudio and the rstudioapi packages. When \code{NULL}, the
script will be run as a job if possible, and as a regular \R process
launched by \code{\link[=system2]{system2()}} if not.}

\item{name}{The name to associate with the job, for scripts run as a job.}

\item{project}{The path to the renv project. This project will be loaded
before the requested script is executed. When \code{NULL} (the default), renv
will automatically determine the project root for the associated script
if possible.}
}
\value{
The project directory, invisibly. Note that this function is normally
called for its side effects.
}
\description{
