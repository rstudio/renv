# Project-local Environments for R

Project-local environments for R.

## Details

You can use renv to construct isolated, project-local R libraries. Each
project using renv will share package installations from a global cache
of packages, helping to avoid wasting disk space on multiple
installations of a package that might otherwise be shared across
projects.
