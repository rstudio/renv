# Install required system libraries

Equip your system with libraries commonly-used during compilation of
base and recommended R packages. This was previously useful with older
versions of R on windows, but is no longer terribly helpful.

## Usage

``` r
equip()
```

## Value

This function is normally called for its side effects.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

# download useful build tools
renv::equip()

} # }
```
