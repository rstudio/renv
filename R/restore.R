#' Restore project library from a lockfile
#'
#' Restore a project's dependencies from a lockfile, as previously generated by
#' [snapshot()]. `renv::restore()` compares packages recorded in the lockfile to
#' the packages installed in the project library. Where there are differences
#' it resolves them by installing the lockfile-recorded package into the
#' project library. If `clean = TRUE`, `restore()` will additionally delete any
#' packages in the project library that don't appear in the lockfile.
#'
#' @inherit renv-params
#'
#' @param library The library paths to be used during restore. See **Library**
#'   for details.
#'
#' @param packages A subset of packages recorded in the lockfile to restore.
#'   When `NULL` (the default), all packages available in the lockfile will be
#'   restored. Any required recursive dependencies of the requested packages
#'   will be restored as well.
#'
#' @param exclude A subset of packages to be excluded during restore. This can
#'  be useful for when you'd like to restore all but a subset of packages from
#'  a lockfile. Note that if you attempt to exclude a package which is required
#'  as the recursive dependency of another package, your request will be
#'  ignored.
#'
#' @return A named list of package records which were installed by renv.
#'
#' @family reproducibility
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @example examples/examples-init.R
