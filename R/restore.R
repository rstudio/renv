#' Restore a Project
#'
#' Restore a project's dependencies from a lockfile, as previously generated by
#' [snapshot()].
#'
#' @section Package Repositories:
#'
#' By default, the package repositories encoded in the lockfile will be used
#' during restore, as opposed to the repositories that might already
#' be set in the current session (through `getOption("repos")`). If you'd like
#' to override the repositories used by `renv` during restore, you can use,
#' for example:
#'
#' ```
#' renv::restore(repos = c(CRAN = <...>))
#' ```
#'
#' See also the `repos.override` option in [config] for an alternate way to
#' provide a repository override.
#'
#' @inherit renv-params
#'
#' @param library The library paths to be used during restore. See **Library**
#'   for details.
#'
#' @param lockfile The lockfile to be used for restoration of the associated
#'   project. When `NULL`, the most recently generated lockfile for this project
#'   is used.
#'
#' @param packages A subset of packages recorded in the lockfile to restore.
#'   When `NULL` (the default), all packages available in the lockfile will be
#'   restored. Any required recursive dependencies of the requested packages
#'   will be restored as well.
#'
#' @param repos The repositories to use during restore, for packages installed
#'   from CRAN or another similar R package repository. When set, this will
#'   override any repositories declared in the lockfile. See also the
#'   `repos.override` option in [config] for an alternate way to provide a
#'   repository override.
#'
#' @return A named list of package records which were installed by `renv`.
#'
#' @section Library:
#'
#' When `renv::restore()` is called, packages from the lockfile are compared
#' against packages currently installed in the library paths specified by
#' `library`. Any packages which have changed will then be installed into the
#' default library. If `clean = TRUE`, then packages that exist within the
#' default library, but aren't recorded in the lockfile, will be removed as
#' well.
#'
#' @family reproducibility

#' @export
