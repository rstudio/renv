#' Copy packages from user libraries to a project library
#'
#' @description
#' `hydrate()` installs missing packages from a user library into the project
#' library. `hydrate()` is called automatically by [init()], and it is rare
#' that you should need it otherwise, as it can easily get your project into
#' an inconsistent state.
#'
#' It may very occasionally be useful to call `hydate(update = "all")` if you
#' want to update project packages to match those installed in your global
#' library (as opposed to using [update()] which will get the latest versions
#' from CRAN). In this case, you should verify that your code continues to work,
#' then call [snapshot()] to record updated package versions in the lockfile.
#'
#' @inherit renv-params
#'
#' @param packages The set of \R packages to install. When `NULL`, the
#'   packages found by [dependencies()] are used.
#'
#' @param library The \R library to be hydrated. When `NULL`, the active
#'   library as reported by `.libPaths()` is used.
#'
#' @param update Boolean; should `hydrate()` attempt to update already-installed
#'   packages if the requested package is already installed in the project
#'   library? Set this to `"all"` if you'd like _all_ packages to be refreshed
#'   from the source library if possible.
#'
#' @param sources A vector of library paths where renv should look for packages.
#'   When `NULL` (the default), `hydrate()` will look in the system libraries
#'   (the user library, the site library and the default library) then the
#'   renv cache.
#'
#'   If a package is not found in any of these locations, `hydrate()`
#'   will try to install it from the active R repositories.
#'
#' @param prompt Boolean; prompt the user before taking any action? Ignored
#'   when `report = FALSE`.
#'
#' @param report Boolean; display a report of what packages will be installed
#'   by `renv::hydrate()`?
#'
#' @return A named \R list, giving the packages that were used for hydration
#'   as well as the set of packages which were not found.
