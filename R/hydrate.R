#' Hydrate a Project
#'
#' Discover the \R packages used within a project, and then install those
#' packages into the active library. This effectively allows you to fork the
#' state of your default \R libraries for use within a project library.
#'
#' It may occasionally be useful to use `renv::hydrate()` to update the packages
#' used within a project that has already been initialized. However, be aware
#' that it's possible that the packages pulled in may not actually be compatible
#' with the packages already installed in the project library, so you should
#' exercise caution when doing so.
#'
#' @section Sources:
#'
#' `hydrate()` attempts to re-use packages already installed on your system,
#' to avoid unnecessary attempts to download and install packages from remote
#' sources. When `NULL` (the default), `hydrate()` will attempt to discover \R
#' packages from the following sources (in order):
#'
#' - The user library,
#' - The site library,
#' - The system library,
#' - The renv cache.
#'
#' If package is discovered in one of these locations, renv will attempt to
#' copy or link that package into the requested library as appropriate.
#'
#' @section Missing Packages:
#'
#' If renv discovers that your project depends on \R packages not currently
#' installed in your user library, then it will attempt to install those
#' packages from the active R repositories.
#'
#' @inherit renv-params
#'
#' @param packages The set of \R packages to install. When `NULL`, the
#'   set of packages as reported by [dependencies()] is used.
#'
#' @param library The \R library to be hydrated. When `NULL`, the active
#'   library as reported by `.libPaths()` is used.
#'
#' @param update Boolean; should `hydrate()` attempt to update already-installed
#'   packages if the requested package is already installed in the project
#'   library? Set this to `"all"` if you'd like _all_ packages to be refreshed
#'   from the source library if possible.
#'
#' @param sources A set of library paths from which renv should attempt to
#'   draw packages. See **Sources** for more details.
#'
#' @param prompt Boolean; prompt the user before taking any action? Ignored
#'   when `report = FALSE`.
#'
#' @param report Boolean; display a report of what packages will be installed
#'   by `renv::hydrate()`?
#'
#' @return A named \R list, giving the packages that were used for hydration
#'   as well as the set of packages which were not found.
