#' Project-local environments for \R.
#'
#' You can use `renv` to construct isolated, project-local \R libraries.
#' Each project using `renv` will share package installations from a global
#' cache of packages, helping to avoid wasting disk space on multiple
#' installations of a package that might otherwise be shared across projects.
