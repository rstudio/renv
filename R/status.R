#' Report inconsistencies between lockfile, library, and dependencies
#'
#' @description
#' `renv::status()` reports issues caused by inconsistencies across the project
#' lockfile, library, and [dependencies()]. In general, you should strive to
#' ensure that `status()` reports no issues, as this maximises your chances of
#' successfully `restore()`ing the project in the future or on another machine.
#'
#' `renv::load()` will report if any issues are detected when starting an
#' renv project; we recommend resolving these issues before doing any
#' further work on your project.
#'
#' See the headings below for specific advice on resolving any issues
#' revealed by `status()`.
#'
#' # Missing packages
#'
#' `status()` first checks that all packages used by the project are installed.
#' This must be done first because if any packages are missing we can't tell for
#' sure that a package isn't used; it might be a dependency that we don't know
#' about. Once you have resolve any installation issues, you'll need to run
#' `status()` again to reveal the next set of potential problems.
#'
#' There are four possibilities for an uninstalled package:
#'
#' * If it's used and recorded, call `renv::restore()` to install the version
#'   specified in the lockfile.
#' * If it's used and not recorded, call `renv::install()` to install it
#'   from CRAN or elsewhere.
#' * If it's not used and recorded, call `renv::snapshot()` to
#'   remove it from the lockfile.
#' * If it's not used and not recorded, there's nothing to do. This the most
#'   common state because you only use a small fraction of all available
#'   packages in any one project.
#'
#' If you have multiple packages in an inconsistent state, we recommend
#' `renv::restore()`, then `renv::install()`, then `renv::snapshot()`, but
#' that also suggests you should be running status more frequently.
#'
#' # Lockfile vs `dependencies()`
#'
#' Next we need to ensure that packages are recorded in the lockfile if and
#' only if they are used by the project. Fixing issues of this nature only
#' requires calling  `snapshot()` because there are four possibilities for
#' a package:
#'
#' * If it's used and recorded, it's ok.
#' * If it's used and not recorded, call `renv::snapshot()` to add it to the
#'   lockfile.
#' * If it's not used but is recorded, call `renv::snapshot()` to remove
#'   it from the lockfile.
#' * If it's not used and not recorded, it's also ok, as it may be a
#'   development dependency.
#'
#' # Out-of-sync sources
#'
#' The final issue to resolve is any inconsistencies between the version of
#' the package recorded in the lockfile and the version installed in your
#' library. To fix these issues you'll need to either call `renv::restore()`
#' or `renv::snapshot()`:
#'
#' * Call `renv::snapshot()` if your project code is working. This implies that
#'   the library is correct and you need to update your lockfile.
#' * Call `renv::restore()` if your project code isn't working. This probably
#'   implies that you have the wrong package versions installed and you need
#'   to restore from known good state in the lockfile.
#'
#' If you're not sure which case applies, it's generally safer to call
#' `renv::snapshot()`. If you want to rollback to an earlier known good
#' status, see [renv::history()] and [renv::revert()].
#'
#' @inherit renv-params
#'
#' @param library The library paths. By default, the library paths associated
#'   with the requested project are used.
#'
#' @param sources Boolean; check that each of the recorded packages have a
#'   known installation source? If a package has an unknown source, renv
#'   may be unable to restore it.
#'
#' @param cache Boolean; perform diagnostics on the global package cache?
#'   When `TRUE`, renv will validate that the packages installed into the
#'   cache are installed at the expected + proper locations, and validate the
#'   hashes used for those storage locations.
#'
#' @inheritParams dependencies
#'
#' @return This function is normally called for its side effects, but
#'   it invisibly returns a list containing the following components:
#'
#'   * `library`: packages in your library.
#'   * `lockfile`: packages in the lockfile.
#'   * `synchronized`: are the library and lockfile in sync?
