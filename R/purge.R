#' Purge packages from the cache
#'
#' Purge packages from the cache. This can be useful if a package which had
#' previously been installed in the cache has become corrupted or unusable,
#' and needs to be reinstalled.
#'
#' `purge()` is an inherently destructive option. It removes packages from the
#' cache, and so any project which had symlinked that package into its own
#' project library would find that package now unavailable. These projects would
#' hence need to reinstall any purged packages. Take heed of this in case you're
#' looking to purge the cache of a package which is difficult to install, or
#' if the original sources for that package are no longer available!
#'
#' @inherit renv-params
#'
#' @param package A single package to be removed from the cache.
#' @param version The package version to be removed. When `NULL`, all versions
#'   of the requested package will be removed.
#' @param hash The specific hashes to be removed. When `NULL`, all hashes
#'   associated with a particular package's version will be removed.
#'
#' @return The set of packages removed from the renv global cache,
#'   as a character vector of file paths.
